# Ant-IRL

Ant(ony) is now a fairly standard RL task from the Open AI gym library. For fun, let's try to bring him to real life (and justify my purchase of a 3D printer).

Here is the Plan:
- Build Ant(ony).
  - CAD in Solid Edge Community Edition

  - Build the robot
  - Code serial interface between arduino and python
- build classical control/fixed loop control system using raspberry pr zero/arduino nano.
- build a test environment.
  - use open CV to detect position using a QR code to calculate reward
  - use the classical control walk to reset the environment
- collect data from the test environment, with the classical control setup, collecting sensor data, and initialise the models using this data.
- Start collecting data from that which is generated by the model, and optimise the ant's walk using actor critic.
